## Configuration fails before compilation

A message that a `thirdparty/` directory such as `thirdparty/bgfx.cmake` is empty means the clone did not fetch the submodules. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` and configure again.

On Windows, use the Visual Studio 2022 generator with `-A Win32` or `-A x64`. On macOS 15 or newer, use Ninja and Apple clang with an arm64 or x86_64 target. Other compilers, Visual Studio versions, and target architectures are unsupported. Configuration stops for MSVC older than 19.30 and for compilers other than MSVC and Apple clang, apart from the experimental clang-cl cross-build that `docs/BUILDING.md` describes.

A build directory holds one platform. Configuring the other platform over it fails, so give each platform its own directory.

If CMake cannot find a Visual Studio installation through the Visual Studio Installer, set `CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE` to its directory and product version, as the repository's `docs/BUILDING.md` describes.

## The executable is not in the run directory

Builds write their runnable files to their build directory's `bin` folder and copy nothing into `Run/`.

On Windows, in `build/bin/<configuration>/`:

- Debug: `GameD.exe`, `GameD.pdb`, `GameD.map`, `Language.dll`, and the `ui/` directory
- Release: `Game.exe`, `Game.pdb`, `Game.map`, `Language.dll`, and the `ui/` directory

On macOS, Debug builds `GameD` and Release builds `Game` in `build/macos/bin/`. The macOS build does not replace `Language.dll`.

## The executable cannot initialize game data

Name the game data directory with [`-DATADIR=<path>`](/using/command-line/data-directory/). Point it at a legitimate Tiberian Sun installation or a copy of its data; the repository and the CMake build directory contain no game assets. A relative path is read from the directory that holds the executable.

If the named path does not exist or is not a directory, the game shows a message that the data directory cannot be used, and exits.
